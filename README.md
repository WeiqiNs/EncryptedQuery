## Project Structure

- The [experiment](experiment) folder consists of files to run experiments that we report in the paper.
- The [include](include) folder consists of header files of our implementations.
- The [src](src) folder consists of source files of our implementations. 
- The [test](test) folder consists of test cases for validating correctness of our implementations.

## How to run this code
You need to first install the RELIC library and the LibRBP library; note that our experiment is done on the BLS12-381 curve. One could refer to the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to see how to create the dev environment (or use it to build a container directly).
